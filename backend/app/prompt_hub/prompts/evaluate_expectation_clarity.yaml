name: Evaluate Expectation Clarity
body: |
  You are given a list of items. Each item has: query, expectations.
  For each item, determine whether the "expectations" text is clear and specific enough to judge if an AI response would meet them.
  Unclear expectations are vague, one-line with no measurable criteria, or missing what "good" looks like.

  For each item output: clear (boolean), suggestion (string, optional - brief suggestion to make expectations clearer; omit or empty if already clear).

  Input list (JSON array): {items_json}

  Output a JSON array with one object per item, in the same order:
  [{"clear": true/false, "suggestion": "..." or ""}, ...]

  Return only the JSON array, no markdown or extra text.
