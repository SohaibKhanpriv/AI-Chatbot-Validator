name: Parse Queries and Expectations
body: |
  You are given raw text or file content that may contain user queries and expected outcomes for an AI assistant.

  Extract every distinct query and its associated expectations. For each item output a JSON object with:
  - "query": the exact or paraphrased user query/instruction
  - "expectations": what the response should satisfy (correctness, tone, character, guardrails, etc.)

  Output a JSON array of such objects. Example format:
  [
    {"query": "What is the capital of France?", "expectations": "Answer should be Paris and be concise."},
    {"query": "Respond as a support agent.", "expectations": "Tone should be professional and helpful; stay in character."}
  ]

  If the input is a list of Q&A pairs, use "query" for the question and "expectations" for the expected answer or criteria.
  If the input has sections or headers, use them to group query/expectation pairs.
  Return only valid JSON array, no markdown or extra text.
